#INTRODUCTION
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

#What is machine learning?
Machine learning is about learning to predict something or extracting knowledge from data. ML is a part of artificial intelligence. ML algorithms build a model based on sample data or known as training data and based upon the training data the algorithm can predict something on new data.
